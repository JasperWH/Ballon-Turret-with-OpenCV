# Turret-with-OpenCV


### Running Code:
You need system administator privliages to run code using GPIO, ufortunatly there is no way (as of Jan 2023) to set p CodeBlocks to do this as such you will have to run the code from the terminal by navigating to the executable then running with sudo:
>cd /home/pi/[...directory to your project...]/bin/Debug

>sudo ./[project name]

e.g.
>cd /home/pi/software/Turret/Turret/bin/Debug

>sudo ./Turret
